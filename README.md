# ✍️ TEMPOS Insight

TEMPOS stands for Tool for Evaluating Media Portrayals of Suicide. This app was developed by Mark David Barranda and Carol Li in partnership with Stanford Medicine and County of Santa Clara Behavioral Health Services. The goal of this app is to assist journalists in reporting suicide related cases that adheres to the framework.

This app leverages the power of AI's decision-making capabilities to evaluate reports based on the TEMPOS Framework. It scores each of the 10 criteria from 0-3 (except for 5 which receives N/A as this model is not trained on visual content), and provides feedback on what can be improved.
